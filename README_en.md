# EasyKiConverter 🔄

**[English](README_en.md)** | [中文](README.md)

A powerful Python tool for converting LCSC and EasyEDA components to KiCad format, supporting complete conversion of symbols, footprints, and 3D models. Features a modern PyQt6 desktop interface with card-based layout that makes component conversion simple and efficient.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functions
- **Symbol Conversion**: Convert EasyEDA symbols to KiCad symbol libraries (.kicad_sym)
- **Footprint Generation**: Create KiCad footprints from EasyEDA packages (.kicad_mod)
- **3D Model Support**: Automatically download and convert 3D models (multiple formats supported)
- **Batch Processing**: Support simultaneous conversion of multiple components
- **Multi-threading Optimization**: Parallel processing of multiple components for significantly improved efficiency
- **Version Compatibility**: Support KiCad 5.x and 6.x+ versions

### 🖥️ PyQt6 Desktop Interface
- **Modern Interface**: Beautiful modern design with card-based layout
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress bar for conversion process with parallel processing status
