# EasyKiConverter üîÑ

**[English](README_en.md)** | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

A powerful Python tool for converting LCSC and EasyEDA components to KiCad format, supporting complete conversion of symbols, footprints, and 3D models. Features a modern PyQt6 desktop interface with card-based layout that makes component conversion simple and efficient.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ Core Functions
- **Symbol Conversion**: Convert EasyEDA symbols to KiCad symbol libraries (.kicad_sym)
- **Footprint Generation**: Create KiCad footprints from EasyEDA packages (.kicad_mod)
- **3D Model Support**: Automatically download and convert 3D models (multiple formats supported)
- **Batch Processing**: Support simultaneous conversion of multiple components
- **Multi-threading Optimization**: Parallel processing of multiple components for significantly improved efficiency
- **Version Compatibility**: Support KiCad 5.x and 6.x+ versions

### üñ•Ô∏è PyQt6 Desktop Interface
- **Modern Interface**: Beautiful modern design with card-based layout
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress bar for conversion process with parallel processing status
- **Flexible Input**: Support LCSC part numbers
- **Selective Export**: Choose to export symbols, footprints, or 3D models
- **Instant Preview**: Real-time display of conversion results with processing time and file statistics
- **Smart Configuration**: Auto-save export settings with BOM file parsing support
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive interface for different screen sizes

### üõ†Ô∏è User-Friendly Design
- **Intuitive Layout**: Clear top-to-bottom workflow with card-based interface
