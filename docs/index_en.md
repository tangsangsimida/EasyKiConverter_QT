## Documentation Principles

- **Docs as Code**: Documentation and code are in the same repository, using plain text formats like Markdown
- **Keep it Alive**: Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation
- **Write for the Audience**: Before writing any documentation, think clearly about who your readers are

## Contributing to Documentation

If you want to improve documentation:

1. Ensure documentation is consistent with code
2. Provide clear examples
3. Keep Chinese and English versions in sync
4. Submit a Pull Request
