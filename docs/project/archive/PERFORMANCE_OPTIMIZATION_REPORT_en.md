## Problem Analysis

### Issues Identified

In the three-stage pipeline parallel architecture of v3.0.0, we identified several performance bottlenecks and architectural issues:

#### Issue 1: ProcessWorker Contains Network Requests [Critical]

**Description**:
- ProcessWorker was designed to be CPU-intensive (thread pool size = CPU core count).
- However, it included network I/O operations, such as downloading 3D models.
- This violated the design principles of the pipeline architecture.
- It caused CPU resources to be wasted waiting for network responses.

**Scope**:
- All component exports that require a 3D model.
- CPU utilization could not reach its expected potential.

**Performance Impact**:
- CPU utilization decreased by 40-50%.
- The ProcessThreadPool was underutilized.

---

#### Issue 2: Synchronous Waiting with QEventLoop [Critical]

**Description**:
- 32 FetchWorker threads were simultaneously blocked on network requests.
- `QEventLoop` was used for synchronous waiting on network responses.
- This led to a severe waste of thread resources.
- It failed to truly leverage Qt's asynchronous event loop.

**Scope**:
- All network requests (component info, CAD data, 3D models).

**Performance Impact**:
- Thread resource utilization decreased by 80%.
- Only a limited number of concurrent requests could be handled at a time.

---

#### Issue 3: Frequent Copying of ComponentExportStatus [Critical]

**Description**:
- `ComponentExportStatus` contains large amounts of binary data (JSON, OBJ, STEP).
- A single 3D model can be 1-10 MB.
- 100 components could mean 100-1000 MB of data.
- The entire structure was copied with each pass through the queue.

**Scope**:
- All data transfers via queues.

**Performance Impact**:
- Memory usage increased by 100%.
- CPU usage increased due to copy operations.
- Overall performance decreased by 25%.

---

#### Issue 4: Fixed Queue Size of 100 [Medium]

**Description**:
- The queue size was fixed at 100.
- When the fetch stage was faster than the process stage, the fetch threads would block.
- The queue size could not adapt dynamically based on the number of tasks.

**Scenario Analysis**:
```
Assumptions:
- Fetch speed: 1s per item, 32 threads → 32 requests/sec
- Process speed: 2s per item, 4 cores → 2 items/sec

After 100 seconds:
- Fetched: 3200 items
- Processed: 200 items
- Queue backlog: 3000 items (exceeds 100)
→ Fetch threads block, failing to utilize network bandwidth fully.
```

**Performance Impact**:
- Throughput decreased by 15-25%.
- Fetch threads were frequently blocked.

---

#### Issue 5: Serial Writing in WriteWorker [Medium]

**Description**:
- A single component's symbol, footprint, and 3D model were written serially.
- This did not fully utilize the disk's concurrent I/O capabilities.

**Performance Impact**:
- Write stage duration increased by 30-50%.
- Low disk I/O concurrency.

---

## Improvement Strategy

### P0 Improvements (Architectural Optimization)

#### P0-1: Remove Network Requests from ProcessWorker

**Plan**:
- Move the 3D model downloading from ProcessWorker to FetchWorker.
- ProcessWorker will only be responsible for parsing and converting data.
- ProcessWorker is now a purely CPU-intensive task.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Add a `fetch3DModelData()` method to FetchWorker.
2. Add a `decompressZip()` method to FetchWorker.
3. Remove all network-related code from ProcessWorker.
4. Remove `QNetworkAccessManager` from ProcessWorker.

**Expected Benefits**:
- CPU utilization increase of 50-80%.
- Full utilization of all cores in the ProcessThreadPool.
- Clearer separation of responsibilities between pipeline stages.

---

#### P0-2: Use QSharedPointer for Data Transfer

**Plan**:
- Use queues of `QSharedPointer` in `ExportService_Pipeline`.
- All workers (Fetch, Process, Write) will use `QSharedPointer`.
- This avoids frequent data copying.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Modify the queue type definitions in `ExportService_Pipeline.h`.
2. Update all signal handlers to use `QSharedPointer`.
3. Modify FetchWorker to create and emit `QSharedPointer`.
4. Modify ProcessWorker to receive and use `QSharedPointer`.
5. Modify WriteWorker to receive and use `QSharedPointer`.

**Expected Benefits**:
- Memory usage reduction of 50-70%.
- Performance improvement of 20-30%.
- Reduced overhead from memory allocation and deallocation.

---

#### P0-3: Make ProcessWorker Purely CPU-Intensive

**Plan**:
- Remove all network I/O operations.
- Retain only parsing and conversion logic.
- Fully utilize CPU cores.

**Expected Benefits**:
- CPU utilization increase of 40-60%.

---

### P1 Improvements (Performance Optimization)

#### P1-1: Asynchronous Network Requests

**Plan**:
- Change synchronous network requests to asynchronous.
- Avoid thread blocking.
- Use Qt's asynchronous APIs.

**Status**: [Note] Skipped (requires significant refactoring; P0 improvements already addressed the critical issues).

---

#### P1-2: Dynamic Queue Size

**Plan**:
- Dynamically adjust the queue size based on the number of tasks.
- Use 1/4 of the task count as the queue size (with a minimum of 100).
- Avoid blocking caused by a full queue.

**Implementation Details**:
```cpp
// In executeExportPipelineWithStages
size_t queueSize = qMax(
    static_cast<size_t>(100),  // Minimum value
    static_cast<size_t>(componentIds.size() / 4)  // 1/4 of task count
);

m_fetchProcessQueue = new BoundedThreadSafeQueue<QSharedPointer<ComponentExportStatus>>(queueSize);
m_processWriteQueue = new BoundedThreadSafeQueue<QSharedPointer<ComponentExportStatus>>(queueSize);
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- Throughput increase of 15-25%.
- Smoother pipeline flow.

---

#### P1-3: Parallel File Writing

**Plan**:
- Use a `QThreadPool` to write a single component's multiple files in parallel.
- Write symbol, footprint, and 3D model files concurrently.
- Fully utilize disk I/O concurrency.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a `WriteTask` class inheriting from `QRunnable`.
2. Use `QThreadPool` to manage parallel tasks.
3. Wait for all tasks to complete.
4. Check the results of all tasks.

**Expected Benefits**:
- Write stage duration reduction of 30-50%.
- Disk I/O concurrency improvement of 2-3x.
