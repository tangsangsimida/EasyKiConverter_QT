## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you:

1. Have read the project documentation:
   - [Project Architecture](ARCHITECTURE_en.md)
   - [Build Guide](BUILD_en.md)
   - [Features Documentation](../user/FEATURES_en.md)

2. Have successfully built the project locally

3. Are familiar with:
   - C++ programming language
   - Qt framework (Qt Quick, Qt Network, etc.)
   - CMake build system
   - MVVM architecture pattern
   - Git version control

## Setting Up Development Environment

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EasyKiConverter.git
   cd EasyKiConverter
   ```

### 2. Configure Remotes

Add the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/tangsangsimida/EasyKiConverter.git
```

### 3. Create a Development Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## Code Standards

### C++ Coding Standards

Follow Qt coding standards:

#### Naming Conventions

- **Class names**: PascalCase
  ```cpp
  class ComponentService { };
  ```

- **Function names**: camelCase
  ```cpp
  void loadData();
  ```

- **Variable names**: camelCase
  ```cpp
  int componentId;
  ```

- **Member variables**: m_ prefix, camelCase
  ```cpp
  int m_componentId;
  ```

- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  ```cpp
  const int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
  ```

#### File Organization

- Header files (.h) and implementation files (.cpp) should be separated
- Each class should have its own header and implementation file
- QML files should be organized by function module
- Resource files should be placed in the `resources/` directory

#### Comments

- Use Doxygen-style comments for classes and public methods
  ```cpp
  /**
   * @brief Loads component data from EasyEDA API
   * @param componentId The component ID to load
   * @return ComponentData The loaded component data
   */
  ComponentData loadComponent(const QString& componentId);
  ```

- Add inline comments for complex logic
  ```cpp
  // Calculate arc center using SVG arc parameters
  double centerX = ...;
  ```

#### C++ Features

- Use C++17 features
- Use smart pointers (QSharedPointer, QScopedPointer) for resource management
- Use Qt's signal-slot mechanism for object communication
- Follow RAII principles
- **File Encoding**: All source files (`.cpp`, `.h`, `.qml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.) MUST use **UTF-8 (without BOM)** encoding. Encodings like UTF-8 with BOM or GBK are strictly prohibited.
- **Tool Validation**: Before submitting code, contributors MUST use the provided encoding conversion tool.
  - Path: `tools/python/convert_to_utf8.py`
  - Usage: `python tools/python/convert_to_utf8.py`
  - This tool ensures all files comply with the UTF-8 without BOM standard.

### QML Coding Standards

- **Component names**: PascalCase
  ```qml
  ModernButton { }
  ```

- **Property names**: camelCase
  ```qml
  property string componentId: ""
  ```

- **ID names**: camelCase
  ```qml
  Button { id: componentInput }
  ```

- **Code formatting**: 4-space indentation
- **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments

## Architecture Requirements

### MVVM Architecture

Follow the MVVM architecture pattern:

- **View Layer (QML)**: Responsible for UI display only
- **ViewModel Layer**: Manages UI state and business logic coordination
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic
- **Model Layer**: Handles data storage

### Export Service Architecture

Use the two-stage pipeline architecture (Fetch → Export):

- **Fetch stage**: concurrent network tasks controlled by the shared network layer (currently 10)
- **Export stage**: builds IR, converts formats, and writes files in parallel
- See: [ADR-002: Pipeline Parallelism](../project/adr/002-pipeline-parallelism-for-export_en.md)

## Development Workflow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the complete feature development, release, and hotfix workflow:

![Git Workflow](../diagrams/Git_Workflow.svg)

**Workflow Summary:**

| Process | Branch Strategy | Merge Method |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Feature Development | `feature/*` → `dev` | Merge commit, preserve history |
| Release | `dev` → `master` | Merge commit, tag version |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/*` → `master` + `dev` | Bidirectional merge, prevent fix loss |
