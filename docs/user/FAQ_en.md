### Can I convert components in batch?

Yes, EasyKiConverter supports batch conversion. You can:
- Use smart extraction to add multiple components
- Import BOM files for batch conversion
- Use parallel conversion for better efficiency

### Where are the converted files?

Converted files are saved in the directory you specified in export settings. You can:
1. Click on file location links in the results list
2. Or manually navigate to the export directory

### How do I use converted components in KiCad?

For detailed steps, please refer to the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE_en.md).

### Which KiCad versions are supported?

KiCad 6.0+, 7.0+, 8.0+, and 9.0+ are supported.

### Which EasyEDA versions are supported?

EasyEDA Standard, EasyEDA Professional, and EasyEDA Pro are supported.

## Conversion Issues

### Why did conversion fail?

Possible reasons:
1. Component ID is incorrect
2. Component does not exist in LCSC database
3. Network connection issues
4. Component data is unavailable

**Solutions:**
- Verify the component ID is correct
- Check network connection
- View error messages in the results list
- Try converting again

### Why was the 3D model not downloaded?

Possible reasons:
1. Component does not have a 3D model
2. "3D Models" option is not enabled
3. Network connection issues

**Solutions:**
- Ensure "3D Models" is enabled in export settings
- Check if the component has a 3D model
- Verify network connection

### What should I do if converted files cannot be opened?

Possible reasons:
1. File is corrupted
2. KiCad version is incompatible
3. File format is incorrect

**Solutions:**
- Convert the component again
- Update KiCad to the latest version
- Check if the file format is correct

### What should I do if conversion is slow?

Optimization suggestions:
- Convert multiple components in batch
- Close other applications
- Use a faster network connection
- Ensure sufficient system resources

### What if conversion results are inconsistent with EasyEDA?

EasyKiConverter strives to maintain consistency with EasyEDA, but minor differences may exist. If you find significant differences:
1. Report the issue on GitHub
2. Provide detailed comparison information
3. Include component ID and screenshots

## Feature Questions

### What is smart extraction?

Smart extraction automatically extracts valid component IDs from clipboard text. It supports:
- Automatic component ID format recognition
- Batch extraction
- Format validation

### What is layer mapping?

Layer mapping is the process of automatically mapping EasyEDA layers to KiCad layers. EasyKiConverter supports mapping of 50+ layers.

### Which 3D model formats are supported?

Supported formats:
- WRL (VRML)
- STEP
- OBJ

### Can I customize layer mapping?

Custom layer mapping is not currently supported. Future versions may add this feature.

### How do I enable debug mode?

**Method 1: Command Line Arguments (Recommended)**
```bash
# Windows
.\build\bin\EasyKiConverter.exe --debug

# Linux/macOS
./build/bin/EasyKiConverter --debug
```

**Method 2: Environment Variable**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:EASYKICONVERTER_DEBUG_MODE="true"
.\build\bin\EasyKiConverter.exe

# Linux/macOS
export EASYKICONVERTER_DEBUG_MODE=true
./build/bin/EasyKiConverter
```

Please refer to the [Debug Mode Configuration](DEBUG_MODE_en.md) documentation for detailed configuration instructions and all available command line arguments.

### What should I do if conversions frequently fail under weak network conditions?

If your network environment is unstable (high latency, high packet loss), you may encounter the following issues:
- Many components marked as failed during batch export
- 3D model download timeouts
- Requests hanging with no response for extended periods

**Solutions:**
- Use a more stable network connection (wired preferred over wireless)
- Reduce the number of components exported simultaneously
- Use the "Retry Export" feature for failed components
- If the problem persists, report the issue on GitHub with a description of your network environment

### "File write failed"

**Cause:** Insufficient disk space or permission issues

**Solutions:**
- Check disk space

- Select a different export directory

### "Conversion failed"

**Cause:** Component data is unavailable or format is incorrect

**Solutions:**
- View detailed error messages
- Try converting again
